## Just a color

This is a very simple web page that fills the browser window with a specified color.

Maybe it's useful for testing something?  Or maybe sometimes you just want to see a lot of some color.

## Usage

Go to [https://sbj42.github.io/just-a-color](https://sbj42.github.io/just-a-color) to try it out.  Just add '#' and a color to the end of the URL.

Examples:
* [green](https://sbj42.github.io/just-a-color#green)
* [F5DF4D](https://sbj42.github.io/just-a-color#F5DF4D)
* [linear-gradient(#3f87a6,#ebf8e1,#f69d3c)](https://sbj42.github.io/just-a-color#linear-gradient(#3f87a6,#ebf8e1,#f69d3c))
